Summary
-------
A unit cube mesh consisting of six tetrahedral elements is used to model a single muscle cell tension response to a twitch calcium transient with an applied traction on the right face. The instruction file is included in the repository, and can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/MMoTH/FEniCS-Myosim/blob/master/demos/cell_isotonic_demo/cell_traction_ramp_hold_demo.json">here</a>.

Simulation Protocol
-------------------
A traction is incrementally applied on the right face of the cube over the first 20 ms, reaching a maximum value of 10 kPa which is fixed for the remainder of the simulation. Then the cell is activated with a skeletal muscle calcium transient approximation[^1] using the [two-compartment calcium](../../../model_formulations/calcium_models/two_compartment_model/two_compartment_model.md) model, and stretch held fixed. Cross-bridge mechanics are simulated using a three-state kinetic scheme[^2].

Boundary Conditions & Assumptions
---------------------------------
- Left face displacement is fixed in the x-direction.
- Right face displacement is prescribed to give the desired magnitude of stretch for the first 10 time step, then switched to a traction boundary on this face of 50 kPa.
- A single point on the left face is completely fixed to prevent rigid body translation.
- The edges on the ends are fixed in either y or z to allow expansion/compression due to incompressibility while keeping the cross-section area rectangular.

Results
-------------------
If plotted using the k_plotter_npy.py file, the cell-level model results are below:

Note, the "muscle" shortens while being activated such that the active stress contribution from cross-bridges and the passive stress response satisfies the traction boundary condition. As [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] decreases (and thus, active stress), the muscle cell is lengthened such that the passive stress response bears the majority of the traction boundary condition. Also note the cross-bridges (bottom left plot) are shifted away from x=0 with the length change. In fact, the rapid length change as active stress drops is responsible for pulling the myosin heads off of binding sites, further facilitating relaxation.
