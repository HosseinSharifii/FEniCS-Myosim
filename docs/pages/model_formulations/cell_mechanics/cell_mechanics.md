Each gauss point within a finite element is treated as a half-sarcomere. The half-sarcomere is modeled via an embedded Python version of [MyoSim](http://www.myosim.org). MyoSim models half-sarcomeres with cross-bridge distribution techniques. In this implementation, MyoSim uses information about half-sarcomere length and intracellular calcium concentration [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] to calculate the active stress generated by a representative half-sarcomere. This stress is then scaled according to the density of half-sarcomeres in tissue and assigned to the local fiber direction.    

### Cross-bridge Kinetics
MyoSim accepts user-defined kinetic schemes. Included in the repository are the 3-state w/SRX[^1] and 4-state w/SRX[^2]
