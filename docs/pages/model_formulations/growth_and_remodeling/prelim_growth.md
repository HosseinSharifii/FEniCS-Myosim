Following the volumetric growth theory introduced by Rodriguez et al.[^1], the deformation gradient is multiplicatively split such that

For a more thorough review see [here](https://rdcu.be/cv6Wj)[^2]. The growth deformation gradient takes the form

where each &theta; dictates growth in either the fiber direction (eccentric growth) or the sheet and sheet normal directions (concentric growth).

where s is a function taking on some stimulus value (varies with position) and s<sub>0</sub> is the stimulus value reached after a steady state simulation. <underline>F</underline><sub>g</sub> is updated and the weak form solved in the absence of any active stress or external load, and <underline>F</underline><sub>e</sub> restores compatibility. The reference mesh is updated such that the nodes take on the positions obtained by applying the displacement solved for, thus relieving residual stresses.
